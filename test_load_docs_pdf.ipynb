Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\\nprimarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\\noutcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\\ninvestigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\\nand sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\\nportant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going\\neﬀorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\\ndevelopment in disciplines like natural language processing and computer\\nvision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\\nThis represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\\nacademic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\\nand humanities.

Currently there is no\n","full-ﬂedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\n","and ﬁne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\n","models and other processing to obtain the ﬁnal outputs.

Due to\n","domain shift [ 7], the prediction performance can notably drop when models are ap-\n","plied to target samples that are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the training dataset. As\n","document structures and layouts vary greatly in diﬀerent domains, it is important\n","to select models trained on a dataset similar to the test samples. A semantic syntax\n","is used for initializing the model weights in LayoutParser , using both the dataset\n","name and model name lp://<dataset-name>/<model-architecture-name> .\n","VALOR 6 Z. Shen et al.\n","Fig. 2: The relationship between the three types of layout data structures.\n","Coordinate supports three kinds of variation; TextBlock consists of the co-\n","ordinate information and extra features like block text, types, and reading orders;\n","aLayout object is a list of all possible layout elements, including other Layout\n","objects. They all support the same set of transformation and operation APIs for\n","maximum ﬂexibility.\n","Shown in Table 1, LayoutParser currently hosts 9 pre-trained models trained\n","on 5 diﬀerent datasets. Description of the training dataset is provided alongside\n","with the trained models such that users can quickly identify the most suitable\n","models for their tasks. Additionally, when such a model is not readily available,\n","LayoutParser also supports training customized layout models and community\n","sharing of the models (detailed in Section 3.5).\n","3.2 Layout Data Structures\n","A critical feature of LayoutParser is the implementation of a series of data\n","structures and operations that can be used to eﬃciently process and manipulate\n","the layout elements. In document image analysis pipelines, various post-processing\n","on the layout analysis model outputs is usually required to obtain the ﬁnal\n","outputs. Traditionally, this requires exporting DL model outputs and then loading\n","the results into other pipelines. All model outputs from LayoutParser will be\n","stored in carefully engineered data types optimized for further processing, which\n","makes it possible to build an end-to-end document digitization pipeline within\n","LayoutParser . There are three key components in the data structure, namely\n","theCoordinate system, the TextBlock , and the Layout . They provide diﬀerent\n","levels of abstraction for the layout data, and a set of APIs are supported for\n","transformations or operations on these classes.\n","VALOR LayoutParser : A Uniﬁed Toolkit for DL-Based DIA 7\n","Coordinates are the cornerstones for storing layout information. Currently,\n","three types of Coordinate data structures are provided in LayoutParser , shown\n","in Figure 2. Interval and Rectangle are the most common data types and\n","support specifying 1D or 2D regions within a document. They are parameterized\n","with 2 and 4 parameters. A Quadrilateral class is also implemented to support\n","a more generalized representation of rectangular regions when the document\n","is skewed or distorted, where the 4 corner points can be speciﬁed and a total\n","of 8 degrees of freedom are supported. A wide collection of transformations\n","likeshift ,pad, and scale , and operations like intersect ,union , and is_in ,\n","are supported for these classes. Notably, it is common to separate a segment\n","of the image and analyze it individually. LayoutParser provides full support\n","for this scenario via image cropping operations crop_image and coordinate\n","transformations like relative_to andcondition_on that transform coordinates\n","to and from their relative representations. We refer readers to Table 2 for a more\n","detailed description of these operations13.\n","Based on Coordinate s, we implement the TextBlock class that stores both\n","the positional and extra features of individual layout elements. It also supports\n","specifying the reading orders via setting the parent ﬁeld to the index of the parent\n","object. A Layout class is built that takes in a list of TextBlock s and supports\n","processing the elements in batch. Layout can also be nested to support hierarchical\n","layout structures. They support the same operations and transformations as the\n","Coordinate classes, minimizing both learning and deployment eﬀort.\n","3.3 OCR\n","LayoutParser provides a uniﬁed interface for existing OCR tools. Though there\n","are many OCR tools available, they are usually conﬁgured diﬀerently with distinct\n","APIs or protocols for using them. It can be ineﬃcient to add new OCR tools into\n","an existing pipeline, and diﬃcult to make direct comparisons among the available\n","tools to ﬁnd the best option for a particular project. To this end, LayoutParser\n","builds a series of wrappers among existing OCR engines, and provides nearly\n","the same syntax for using them. It supports a plug-and-play style of using OCR\n","engines, making it eﬀortless to switch, evaluate, and compare diﬀerent OCR\n","modules:\n","1ocr_agent = lp. TesseractAgent ()\n","2# Can be easily switched to other OCR software\n","3tokens = ocr_agent . detect ( image )\n","The OCR outputs will also be stored in the aforementioned layout data\n","structures and can be seamlessly incorporated into the digitization pipeline.\n","Currently LayoutParser supports the Tesseract and Google Cloud Vision OCR\n","engines.\n","LayoutParser also comes with a DL-based CNN-RNN OCR model [ 6] trained\n","with the Connectionist Temporal Classiﬁcation (CTC) loss [ 10]. It can be used\n","like the other OCR modules, and can be easily trained on customized datasets.\n","13This is also available in the LayoutParser documentation pages.\n","VALOR 8 Z.

LayoutParser supports exporting layout data into diﬀerent\n","formats like JSON,csv, and will add the support for the METS/ALTO XML\n","format14. It can also load datasets from layout analysis-speciﬁc formats like\n","COCO [38] and the Page Format [25] for training layout models (Section 3.5).\n","Visualization of the layout detection results is critical for both presentation\n","and debugging. LayoutParser is built with an integrated API for displaying the\n","layout information along with the original document image. Shown in Figure 3, it\n","enables presenting layout data with rich meta information and features in diﬀerent\n","modes. More detailed information can be found in the online LayoutParser\n","documentation page.\n","3.5 Customized Model Training\n","Besides the oﬀ-the-shelf library, LayoutParser is also highly customizable with\n","supports for highly unique and challenging document analysis tasks. Target\n","document images can be vastly diﬀerent from the existing datasets for train-\n","ing layout models, which leads to low layout detection accuracy.

In this ﬁgure, tokens in textual regions are ﬁltered using the API and\n","then displayed.\n","can also be highly sensitive and not sharable publicly. To overcome these chal-\n","lenges, LayoutParser is built with rich features for eﬃcient data annotation and\n","customized model training.\n","LayoutParser incorporates a toolkit optimized for annotating document lay-\n","outs using object-level active learning [ 32]. With the help from a layout detection\n","model trained along with labeling, only the most important layout objects within\n","each image, rather than the whole image, are required for labeling. The rest of\n","the regions are automatically annotated with high conﬁdence predictions from\n","the layout detection model. This allows a layout dataset to be created more\n","eﬃciently with only around 60% of the labeling budget.\n","After the training dataset is curated, LayoutParser supports diﬀerent modes\n","for training the layout models. Fine-tuning can be used for training models on a\n","small newly-labeled dataset by initializing the model with existing pre-trained\n","weights. Training from scratch can be helpful when the source dataset and\n","target are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent and a large training set is available. However, as\n","suggested in Studer et al.’s work[ 33], loading pre-trained weights on large-scale\n","datasets like ImageNet [ 5], even from totally diﬀerent domains, can still boost\n","model performance. Through the integrated API provided by LayoutParser ,\n","users can easily compare model performances on the benchmark datasets.\n","VALOR 10 Z.

The reorganization algorithm rearranges\n","the tokens based on the their detected bounding boxes given a maximum allowed\n","height.\n","4LayoutParser Community Platform\n","Another focus of LayoutParser is promoting the reusability of layout detection\n","models and full digitization pipelines. Similar to many existing deep learning\n","libraries, LayoutParser comes with a community model hub for distributing\n","layout models. End-users can upload their self-trained models to the model hub,\n","and these models can be loaded into a similar interface as the currently available\n","LayoutParser pre-trained models. For example, the model trained on the News\n","Navigator dataset [17] has been incorporated in the model hub.\n","Beyond DL models, LayoutParser also promotes the sharing of entire doc-\n","ument digitization pipelines. For example, sometimes the pipeline requires the\n","combination of multiple DL models to achieve better accuracy. Currently, pipelines\n","are mainly described in academic papers and implementations are often not pub-\n","licly available. To this end, the LayoutParser community platform also enables\n","the sharing of layout pipelines to promote the discussion and reuse of techniques.\n","For each shared pipeline, it has a dedicated project page, with links to the source\n","code, documentation, and an outline of the approaches. A discussion panel is\n","provided for exchanging ideas. Combined with the core LayoutParser library,\n","users can easily build reusable components based on the shared pipelines and\n","apply them to solve their unique problems.\n","5 Use Cases\n","The core objective of LayoutParser is to make it easier to create both large-scale\n","and light-weight document digitization pipelines. Large-scale document processing\n","VALOR LayoutParser : A Uniﬁed Toolkit for DL-Based DIA 11\n","focuses on precision, eﬃciency, and robustness. The target documents may have\n","complicated structures, and may require training multiple layout detection models\n","to achieve the optimal accuracy. Light-weight pipelines are built for relatively\n","simple documents, with an emphasis on development ease, speed and ﬂexibility.\n","Ideally one only needs to use existing resources, and model training should be\n","avoided. Through two exemplar projects, we show how practitioners in both\n","academia and industry can easily build such pipelines using LayoutParser and\n","extract high-quality structured document data for their downstream tasks. The\n","source code for these projects will be publicly available in the LayoutParser\n","community hub.\n","5.1 A Comprehensive Historical Document Digitization Pipeline\n","The digitization of historical documents can unlock valuable data that can shed\n","light on many important social, economic, and historical questions. Yet due to\n","scan noises, page wearing, and the prevalence of complicated layout structures, ob-\n","taining a structured representation of historical document scans is often extremely\n","complicated.\n","Fig. 5: Illustration of how LayoutParser\n","helps with the historical document digi-\n","tization pipeline.In this example, LayoutParser was\n","used to develop a comprehensive\n","pipeline, shown in Figure 5, to gener-\n","ate high-quality structured data from\n","historical Japanese ﬁrm ﬁnancial ta-\n","bles with complicated layouts. The\n","pipeline applies two layout models to\n","identify diﬀerent levels of document\n","structures and two customized OCR\n","engines for optimized character recog-\n","nition accuracy.\n","As shown in Figure 4 (a), the\n","document contains columns of text\n","written vertically15, a common style\n","in Japanese. Due to scanning noise\n","and archaic printing technology, the\n","columns can be skewed or have vari-\n","able widths, and hence cannot be eas-\n","ily identiﬁed via rule-based methods.\n","Within each column, words are sepa-\n","rated by white spaces of variable size,\n","and the vertical positions of objects\n","can be an indicator of their layout\n","type.\n","15A document page consists of eight rows like this.

Shen et al.\n","To decipher the complicated layout\n","structure, two object detection models have been trained to recognize individual\n","columns and tokens, respectively. A small training set (400 images with approxi-\n","mately 100 annotations each) is curated via the active learning based annotation\n","tool [ 32] inLayoutParser . The models learn to identify both the categories and\n","regions for each token or column via their distinct visual features. The layout\n","data structure enables easy grouping of the tokens within each column, and\n","rearranging columns to achieve the correct reading orders based on the horizontal\n","position. Errors are identiﬁed and rectiﬁed via checking the consistency of the\n","model predictions. Therefore, though trained on a small dataset, the pipeline\n","achieves a high level of layout detection accuracy: it achieves a 96.97 AP [ 19]\n","score across 5 categories for the column detection model, and a 89.23 AP across\n","4 categories for the token detection model.\n","A combination of character recognition methods is developed to tackle the\n","unique challenges in this document. In our experiments, we found that irregular\n","spacing between the tokens led to a low character recognition recall rate, whereas\n","existing OCR models tend to perform better on densely-arranged texts. To\n","overcome this challenge, we create a document reorganization algorithm that\n","rearranges the text based on the token bounding boxes detected in the layout\n","analysis step. Figure 4 (b) illustrates the generated image of dense text, which is\n","sent to the OCR APIs as a whole to reduce the transaction costs. The ﬂexible\n","coordinate system in LayoutParser is used to transform the OCR results relative\n","to their original positions on the page.\n","Additionally, it is common for historical documents to use unique fonts\n","with diﬀerent glyphs, which signiﬁcantly degrades the accuracy of OCR models\n","trained on modern texts. In this document, a special ﬂat font is used for printing\n","numbers and could not be detected by oﬀ-the-shelf OCR engines. Using the highly\n","ﬂexible functionalities from LayoutParser , a pipeline approach is constructed\n","that achieves a high recognition accuracy with minimal eﬀort. As the characters\n","have unique visual structures and are usually clustered together, we train the\n","layout model to identify number regions with a dedicated category. Subsequently,\n","LayoutParser crops images within these regions, and identiﬁes characters within\n","them using a self-trained OCR model based on a CNN-RNN [ 6]. The model\n","detects a total of 15 possible categories, and achieves a 0.98 Jaccard score16and\n","a 0.17 average Levinstein distances17for token prediction on the test set.\n","Overall, it is possible to create an intricate and highly accurate digitization\n","pipeline for large-scale digitization using LayoutParser . The pipeline avoids\n","specifying the complicated rules used in traditional methods, is straightforward\n","to develop, and is robust to outliers. The DL models also generate ﬁne-grained\n","results that enable creative approaches like page reorganization for OCR.\n","16This measures the overlap between the detected and ground-truth characters, and\n","the maximum is 1.\n","17This measures the number of edits from the ground-truth text to the predicted text,\n","and lower is better.\n","VALOR LayoutParser : A Uniﬁed Toolkit for DL-Based DIA 13\n","Fig. 6: This lightweight table detector can identify tables (outlined in red) and\n","cells (shaded in blue) in diﬀerent locations on a page. In very few cases (d), it\n","might generate minor error predictions, e.g, failing to capture the top text line of\n","a table.\n","5.2 A light-weight Visual Table Extractor\n","Detecting tables and parsing their structures (table extraction) are of central im-\n","portance for many document digitization tasks. Many previous works [ 26,30,27]\n","and tools18have been developed to identify and parse table structures. Yet they\n","might require training complicated models from scratch, or are only applicable\n","for born-digital PDF documents. In this section, we show how LayoutParser can\n","help build a light-weight accurate visual table extractor for legal docket tables\n","using the existing resources with minimal eﬀort.\n","The extractor uses a pre-trained layout detection model for identifying the\n","table regions and some simple rules for pairing the rows and the columns in the\n","PDF image. Mask R-CNN [ 12] trained on the PubLayNet dataset [ 38] from the\n","LayoutParser Model Zoo can be used for detecting table regions. By ﬁltering\n","out model predictions of low conﬁdence and removing overlapping predictions,\n","LayoutParser can identify the tabular regions on each page, which signiﬁcantly\n","simpliﬁes the subsequent steps. By applying the line detection functions within\n","the tabular segments, provided in the utility module from LayoutParser , the\n","pipeline can identify the three distinct columns in the tables. A row clustering\n","method is then applied via analyzing the y coordinates of token bounding boxes in\n","the left-most column, which are obtained from the OCR engines. A non-maximal\n","suppression algorithm is used to remove duplicated rows with extremely small\n","gaps. Shown in Figure 6, the built pipeline can detect tables at diﬀerent positions\n","on a page accurately. Continued tables from diﬀerent pages are concatenated,\n","and a structured table representation has been easily created.\n","18https://github.com/atlanhq/camelot, https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula\n","VALOR 14 Z. Shen et al.\n","6 Conclusion\n","LayoutParser provides a comprehensive toolkit for deep learning-based document\n","image analysis. The oﬀ-the-shelf library is easy to install, and can be used to\n","build ﬂexible and accurate pipelines for processing documents with complicated\n","structures. It also supports high-level customization and enables easy labeling and\n","training of DL models on unique document image datasets. The LayoutParser\n","community platform facilitates sharing DL models and DIA pipelines, inviting\n","discussion and promoting code reproducibility and reusability. The LayoutParser\n","team is committed to keeping the library updated continuously and bringing\n","the most recent advances in DL-based DIA, such as multi-modal document\n","modeling [37, 36, 9] (an upcoming priority), to a diverse audience of end-users.\n","Acknowledgements We thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments\n","and suggestions.

We now provide detailed descriptions for each\\ncomponent.\\n3.1 Layout Detection Models\\nInLayoutParser , a layout model takes a document image as an input and\\ngenerates a list of rectangular boxes for the target content regions. Diﬀerent\\nfrom traditional methods, it relies on deep convolutional neural networks rather\\nthan manually curated rules to identify content regions. It is formulated as an\\nobject detection problem and state-of-the-art models like Faster R-CNN [ 28] and\\nMask R-CNN [ 12] are used. This yields prediction results of high accuracy and\\nmakes it possible to build a concise, generalized interface for layout detection.\\nLayoutParser , built upon Detectron2 [ 35], provides a minimal API that can\\nperform layout detection with only four lines of code in Python:\\n1import layoutparser as lp\\n2image = cv2. imread (\" image_file \") # load images\\n3model = lp.

Due to\\ndomain shift [ 7], the prediction performance can notably drop when models are ap-\\nplied to target samples that are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the training dataset. As\\ndocument structures and layouts vary greatly in diﬀerent domains, it is important\\nto select models trained on a dataset similar to the test samples.

It enables the sharing of pretrained models as well as\\nfull document processing pipelines that are unique to DIA tasks.\\nThere have been a variety of document data collections to facilitate the\\ndevelopment of DL models. Some examples include PRImA [ 3](magazine layouts),\\nPubLayNet [ 38](academic paper layouts), Table Bank [ 18](tables in academic\\npapers), Newspaper Navigator Dataset [ 16,17](newspaper ﬁgure layouts) and\\nHJDataset [31](historical Japanese document layouts). A spectrum of models\\ntrained on these datasets are currently available in the LayoutParser model zoo\\nto support diﬀerent use cases.\\n3 The Core LayoutParser Library\\nAt the core of LayoutParser is an oﬀ-the-shelf toolkit that streamlines DL-\\nbased document image analysis. Five components support a simple interface\\nwith comprehensive functionalities: 1) The layout detection models enable using\\npre-trained or self-trained DL models for layout detection with just four lines\\nof code. 2) The detected layout information is stored in carefully engineered'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":27}]}]}
